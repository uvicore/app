# On install

Don't assume poetry, but my working app stub will use poetry

delete poetry.lock, pyproject.toml

They can pick which venv, virtualenv, poetry or pipenv and I have to create stubs for those.
Maybe include folders with those stubs, then replace files and delete other stubs
Maybe a .stubs directory that is deleted after all is installed.

Maybe DONT install anything, just make a pyenv or poetry file, they have to make their ENV and install themselves.




Don't assume python version

delete .python-version


README

Set readme properly.  Remember to add how to serve manually with gunicorn and uvicorn.
